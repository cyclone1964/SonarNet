% Strength = 
%    computeBottomScatteringStrength(Frequency, Angle, Environment) 
%
% computes the bottom scattering strength for the given frequency and
% angle. It supports multiple frequencies and angles: different
% frequencies are returned in different columnns, different angles in
% different rows.
%
% This is currently implemnted as a table lookup, and presumes the
% existence of data files named 'BTMSTRXX.dat', where
% 'XX' is the Bulk Grain Size.
