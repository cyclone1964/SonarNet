% Strength = 
%    computeSurfaceScatteringStrength(Type, Frequency, Angle,
%    Environment) 
%
% computes the surface scattering strength for the given frequency and
% angle. It supports multiple frequencies and angles: different
% frequencies are returned in different columnns, different angles in
% different rows.
%
% This is currently implmented as a table lookup, and presumes the
% existence of data files named 'SurfaceScatteringStrengthXX.dat', where
% 'XX' is the wind speed in m/s, and
% 'BottomScatteringStrengthXX.dat' where XXX is the bulk grain
% size, a number between -9 and 9. These parameters are taken from
% the environment and rounded to the nearest integer
